# AUSTRALIAN SENATE RANKER
By Jan Zika (jan.david.zika at gmail.com)

THis is where I am putting spreadsheets I have made to make it easier to rank candidates at Australian Elections.

The spreadsheets in this repository are provided 'as is' without any garauntee of quality nor lack of bugs or errors.

I made these spreadsheets to make it easier for me and others to number every candiate below the line at the Australian Federal Election.

Let me know if you find any issues or have suggestions and I'll consider them. I know this would be much nicer as a web based app but I dont have the energy for that.
